Dear Colleague,

We would like to invite you to participate in the 18th Compiler-Driven Performance Workshop (CDP ‘19) which will be held on Wednesday November 6 2019. CDP will be co-located with the 29th International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (CASCON 2019) in Markham, ON, Canada.

The workshop has a particular focus on (but not limited to):
* Innovative compiler analysis, transformation, and optimization techniques
* Languages, compilers, and optimization techniques for multicore processors and other parallel architectures
* Compiling for streaming or heterogeneous hardware
* Dynamic compilation for high-performance and real-time environments
* Compilation, optimization, and analysis for dynamic languages
* Compilation techniques for reducing power
* Program safety
* Whole system optimization and analysis
* Tools and infrastructure for compiler research

CDP 2019 invites contributions in the form of talk abstracts from researchers and practitioners. Each submission should include:
* Talk title,
* Author list with affiliations
* A brief abstract.
* Please also identify the presenter and include a 1-2 sentence biography.

All submissions should be made through EasyChair no later than *Thursday, September 19th, 2019*.

Registration for CASCON is now required, for all attendees and speakers. Please see the registration tab at:
  http://cascon.ca
Attending CDP requires you register for at least the one-day (November 6) conference attendance.  You can do that after receiving notification.  If, however, you intend to attend the full conference, note that discounts are available for early registration, with the first early bird deadline of September 8.

CDP does not publish proceedings. Presenters are required to provide an electronic copy of their slides. The slides will be available on this website soon after the workshop. Work that has been recently published or submitted for publication is welcome.

We look forward to your participation in CDP ‘19!
