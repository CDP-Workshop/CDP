* Compiling for streaming or heterogeneous hardware
* Dynamic compilation for high-performance and real-time environments
* Compilation, optimization, and analysis for dynamic languages
* Compilation techniques for reducing power
* Program safety
* Whole system optimization and analysis
* Tools and infrastructure for compiler research

CDP 2019 invites contributions in the form of talk abstracts from
researchers and practitioners. Each submission should include:

* Talk title,
* Author list with affiliations
* A brief abstract.
* Please also identify the presenter and include a 1-2 sentence biography.
