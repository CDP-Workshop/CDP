  </p>

	<p>CDP invites contributions in the form of an extended abstract from researchers and practitioners.
	  A submission should consist of a single one-page PDF and include:
<ul>
  <li> Talk title</li>

	  Work presented does not need to be original: work that has been recently published or submitted for publication elsewhere is
	  welcome.
	  In such case a link to the prior publication/submission should be added to the submission.</p>
